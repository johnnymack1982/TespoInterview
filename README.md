# TespoInterview

## Conway's Game of Life - John Mack
This project was created at the request of Aaron Feys as a part of the interview process for Tespo.

For fun, I decided to go ahead and build this in Android Studio. Minimal focus was placed on the UI as the primary reason for this project is to demonstrate the ability to think through the logic behind the problem.

I'm sure there are much more efficient ways to solve this and, as it is such an interesting challenge, I will likely continue to explore alternative solutions.

### The Rules
1) Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
2) Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3) Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4) Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


Please download and run in Android Studio.
Thank you again for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you again soon!
